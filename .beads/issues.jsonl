{"id":"service_status-zyc","title":"Add response time tracking","description":"Inspired by Cyclenerd/static_status: Track and display response times for each check.\n\nThe static_status project tracks time_sec for each check:\n```json\n{\"site\": \"...\", \"status\": \"OK\", \"time_sec\": \"0\"}\n```\n\nThere's also an open feature request (#9) to display latency on the page.\n\nBenefits:\n- Identify slow services before they fail\n- Performance trending over time\n- SLA compliance monitoring\n- Degraded status based on response time thresholds\n\nImplementation:\n1. Measure request duration in each check type\n2. Store response time alongside status\n3. Display on status page (e.g., '✓ 45ms')\n4. Optionally mark slow responses as degraded","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"sion5@hotmail.co.uk","created_at":"2026-01-22T13:34:58.409894Z","created_by":"Sion Williams","updated_at":"2026-01-22T13:34:58.409894Z"}
